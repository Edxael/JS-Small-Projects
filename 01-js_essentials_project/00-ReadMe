This is the final project of a very basic JavaScript course with name: "JavaScript Essentials" by: Lawrence Turton

On this project we will create a simple HTML file with a square and three drop-down menues with diferent values that apply to CSS properties for the square

then we will create .js file that will change the square when the user change the values on the drop-down menues
	for more explanation in how it works read the code on the file 02-project.js
